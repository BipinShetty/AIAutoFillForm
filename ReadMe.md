# Google Form Auto Filler Using Selenium & OpenAI GPT

This project automatically analyzes and answers Google Form questions using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. It simulates how a human would interpret and respond to form questions across various input types (text, multiple choice, checkboxes, and dropdown menus) and fills in the form accordingly‚Äîwithout submitting it, so you can review the AI-selected responses before final submission.
